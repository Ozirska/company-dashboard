# Company Dashboard — Test Task

This project is a small dashboard built with React, React Mosaic, and Recharts.
It displays company information, securities data, and a generated stock price chart for different tickers.

The application loads mock data from the /fake_api folder and allows switching between companies using a dropdown selector.
Each company widget is displayed inside a Mosaic window, allowing users to rearrange, resize, and split the layout interactively.

# Features

Mosaic window layout using react-mosaic-component

Company info + securities info widgets

Responsive chart using Recharts

Dropdown selection for switching companies

Fake API using static .json files

Responsive design with TailwindCSS

Fully containerized using Docker

# About the Data

The project uses two mock API files:

companies-lookup.json — list of companies

securities.json — securities mapped by company_id

# How to Extend

If I had more time, I could improve:

Persist mosaic layout: Save the user’s layout (tiles and positions) to localStorage so it stays the same after refresh.

Improve design: Add better styling and visual polish.

Enhance responsiveness: Make the layout more adaptive across screen sizes.
